# 2D Spacecraft Prototype (Node.js Version)

This is a 2D spacecraft simulation game, now served via a Node.js backend.

## Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

## Original Project
This project is a conversion of a client-side JavaScript game to be served by a Node.js application. The core game logic remains client-side.
